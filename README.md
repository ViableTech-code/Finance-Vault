# 🛠 Viable Frontend Codebase – Setup Guide

Welcome to the **Viable Frontend** codebase! This guide will help you get up and running in just a few minutes.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js and npm** installed.
We recommend using [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for easier version control.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Open your terminal and follow these steps:

```sh
# 1. Clone the repository using your Git URL
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# 2. Move into the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the local development server
npm run dev
```

The app will start with live reloading — changes you make in code will instantly reflect in the browser.

## ✏️ Editing Files Directly on GitHub

You can also make quick edits in-browser:

1. Navigate to the file you want to modify.
2. Click the **pencil icon** in the top-right corner.
3. Make your changes.
4. Scroll down, add a commit message, and hit **Commit changes**.

## 🧑‍💻 Using GitHub Codespaces (Optional)

If you prefer a cloud-based development environment:

1. Go to your repository’s GitHub page.
2. Click the green **Code** button and switch to the **Codespaces** tab.
3. Click **New codespace**.
4. Your full dev environment launches — no local setup needed.
5. Edit, test, commit, and push changes directly from Codespaces.
